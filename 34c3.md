## Motivation
* Single vendors are bad
* Open Source doesn’t help
* Phone numbers 

Note: After being a Jabber User for more than a decade I started  working on my own Jabber client four years ago and later became actively involved in the XMPP community.

While there are many reasons for using Jabber instead of WhatsApp or Signal by personal motivation is that I don’t want a single company to control my communication. Not only do companys like Facebook see whom I communicating with they can also control whom I’m communicating with. Or even worse; stop me from communicating at all.

Or to put this in other words; I don’t want to get in a Twitter-fight with Moxie only to wake up one morning and not being able to use Signal anymore. And this has nothing to do with being paranoid. Companies have kicked people of their networks before. There is this interview with the CEO of cloudflare where he describes that he woke up one morning and decided to [take the daily stormer of the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULXWJgmhP1c).

This is also the point where just being open source doesn’t help you at all. If Moxie decides he doesn’t want me to use Signal there is absolutely no benefit in Signal being open source. Yes I can setup my own server. But nobody else would be using that server.

I’m also not a huge fan of instant messengers being tied to my phone number. While I’m totaly fine with putting my Jabber ID on my website or handing that out to new people I meet I’m not comfortable handing my phone number out to random strangers.

# Future

---

## OMEMO by default
* Easier trust model
* World readable keys
* Deployment

----

### Easier trust model
* TOFU is difficult to apply
* BTBV
 * Trust everything by default
 * Trust new keys
 * After scanning a contact, stop trusting new keys from that contact

----

### World readable keys
* `publish_options`
* `mod_omemo_all_access`

----

### Deployment
* Every plattform has at least on client
* [omemo.top](https://omemo.top)

---

## OTR must go away
* Unreliable
* Doesn’t work with multiple devices
* Auto response loops

---

## Image Thumbnails
* XEP-0385: Stateless Inline Media Sharing
* OMEMO: Data URIs
* Size limit (10,000 bytes)

---

## Initial login
* Initial login / discovery expensive
* Resume requires TLS and SASL

---

## Message routing
* Delivery to multiple devices
* Offline delivery / catchup

---

## SPAM
* »Cyber criminals« spamming each other
* Be careful about publishing your JID
* Blocking made easy / No notifications
