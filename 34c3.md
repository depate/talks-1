## Motivation
* Single vendors are bad
* Open Source doesn’t help
* Phone numbers 

Note: bla bla bla

---

## Jabber/XMPP
* Provider independent
* IETF working group since 2002
* Extensions *published* by the XSF

----

### Jabber or XMPP?
* Jabber = Ecosystem (Email, Web)
* XMPP = Protcol (IMAP, SMTP, HTTP)

----

### Jabber vs Matrix
* Similiar goals
* Personal preference
* Gateways are flawed

---

## 2016
* Reliable & battery friendly ¹
* Multiple devices ¹
* Media transfer ¹
* Group chats
* Optional: E2EE ¹

<p><small>¹ When using a modern client and server</small></p>

# 2017

---

## Direct TLS / SNI

# Future

---

## OMEMO by default
* Easier trust model
* World readable keys
* Deployment

----

### Easier trust model
* TOFU is difficult to apply
* BTBV
 * Trust everything by default
 * Trust new keys
 * After scanning a contact, stop trusting new keys from that contact

----

### World readable keys
* `publish_options`
* `mod_omemo_all_access`

----

### Deployment
* Every plattform has at least on client
* [omemo.top](https://omemo.top)

---

## OTR must go away
* Unreliable
* Doesn’t work with multiple devices
* Auto response loops

---

## Image Thumbnails
* XEP-0385: Stateless Inline Media Sharing
* OMEMO: Data URIs
* Size limit (10,000 bytes)

---

## Initial login
* Initial login / discovery expensive
* Resume requires TLS and SASL

---

## Message routing
* Delivery to multiple devices
* Offline delivery / catchup

---

## SPAM
* »Cyber criminals« spamming each other
* Be careful about publishing your JID
* Blocking made easy / No notifications
